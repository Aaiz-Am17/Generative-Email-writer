**Mentor** is a beginner-friendly desktop app designed as an **introductory project** for exploring Generative AI and API integration. It uses Google's PaLM model to help users generate polished, professional emails from **minimal prompts** like:

> `"say sorry"` → ✉️ A formal apology email  
> `"thank my manager"` → ✉️ A gratitude message  
> `"request for deadline extension"` → ✉️ A polite request

---

💡 The core idea behind Mentor is to assist people who may not be fluent in English — especially in workplaces where formal communication is expected via email. With just a short phrase, Mentor delivers well-structured, context-aware email drafts you can send with confidence.

🙋‍♂️ Why I Built This
As a student exploring Generative AI and real-world API integration, I built Mentor to solve a problem many face: writing clear, professional emails with limited English proficiency. This project serves as an intro-level demonstration of how language models can simplify daily communication tasks for everyone.
